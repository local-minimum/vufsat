NEXT THING
----------

Move the Circular vs Linear to the most basic model-object thing
(is it the interface or the abstract class)

Make default allowMove for topology to check if next pos is being wrapped
and if so make sure the shapeType is CIRCULAR

Make the sequence walker iterator use the nextPos point to check if move next 
segment is allowed (both start and stop)
